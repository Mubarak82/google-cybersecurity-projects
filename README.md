# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate - Projects

This repository contains cybersecurity projects completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**. These hands-on projects demonstrate my ability to analyze security incidents, manage risks, and implement security measures using various tools and techniques.

## üìå Projects Overview

1. **Controls and Compliance Checklist**  
   *A security audit assessing controls like Least Privilege, Disaster Recovery, and GDPR compliance.*
   
2. **Apply Filters to SQL Queries**  
   *Used SQL queries to filter security-related data, such as failed login attempts and unauthorized access.*

3. **File Permissions in Linux**  
   *Managed Linux file permissions using `chmod`, `ls -la`, and security best practices.*

4. **Vulnerability Assessment Report**  
   *Conducted a vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, and provided remediation strategies.*

5. **Update a File Through a Python Algorithm**  
   *Developed a Python script to update an IP allow-list by removing unauthorized addresses.*

6. **Incident Report Analysis**  
   *Investigated and mitigated a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack using firewall and IDS solutions.*

7. **Home Asset Inventory**  
   *Created an inventory of home network devices, assessing security risks and sensitivity levels.*
